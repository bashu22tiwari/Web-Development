            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p><span>HELLO READERS</span>, MY NAME IS BASU TIWARI. I AM BASICALLY FROM SAGAR(MP), AND MY FATHER IS AN EX-SUB, FROM THE INDIAN ARMY. TODAY I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE MY SSB JOURNEY WITH YOU ALL. I HAD GONE THROUGH A TOTAL NUMBER OF 6 SSB, AND MY TRIP CONSISTED OF MANY UPS AND DOWNS. IN THIS GREAT JOURNEY, I WENT THROUGH TWO RECOMMENDATIONS, TWO CONFERENCES OUT AND THE REST SCREEN OUTS. THOUGH ITâ€™S BEEN A YEAR SINCE MY LAST SSB, I WILL TRY TO GATHER AS MANY POINTS AS TO PROVIDE YOU ALL WITH THE PROPER INSIGHT.</p>
