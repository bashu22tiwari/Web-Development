            <p>Hello readers, my name is Basu Tiwari. I am basically from Sagar(MP), and my father is an Ex-Sub, from the Indian army. Today I would love to share my SSB journey with you all. I had gone through a total number of 6 SSB, and my trip consisted of many ups and downs. In this great journey, I went through two recommendations, two conferences out and the rest screen outs. Though itâ€™s been a year since my last SSB, I will try to gather as many points as to provide you all with the proper insight.</p>
